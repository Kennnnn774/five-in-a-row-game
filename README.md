# Five-in-a-Row Online Game

Five-in-a-Row is a classic strategy board game where players aim to align five of their stones in a row, whether it's horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This digital version provides three modes: a local AI mode, a local player-vs-player mode, and an online multiplayer mode.

## Features:

- **AI Mode:** Play against a smart AI opponent that dynamically changes its strategy between blocking your moves and making its own winning combinations.
- **Local Player-vs-Player:** Engage in a local match with a friend on the same device.
- **Online Multiplayer:** Play against friends or random players online in a real-time setting.
